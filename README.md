# JokesApp
Sole purpose for this is to for me to practice architectures and familiarize myself with REST API, practice making API calls. 

Description: VERY VERY basic jokes app with Zero View, ONE View model and ONE VC. 

ViewModel is a Singleton, handles logic for making API calls. 
Not using a view because I am using XIB files for UI
VC holds all the other stuff :)
